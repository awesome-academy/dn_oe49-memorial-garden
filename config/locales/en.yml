    content: "This website was build to be a place where people could create an online memorial to collect and share memories of the people they have lost. Hopefully, it will ease the nostalgia and give the feeling that they still exist. Quote from the special girl, i knew:"
    quote: "Well, Greg, I think that it just means that even after somebody dies, you can... you can still keep learning about them, you know, their life. It can keep unfolding itself to you just as long... just as long as you pay attention to it."
